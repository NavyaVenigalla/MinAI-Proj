# Minor in AI Project(Content Recommendation System)
This project is an AI-powered Occasion-Based Clothes Recommendation System that suggests suitable clothing based on the selected occasion such as Temple, Function, Office, Travel, and Home.
The system uses image–text similarity with the CLIP model to recommend visually relevant outfits from a curated dataset of clothing images. Users can easily select an occasion through an interactive Streamlit-based web interface, making the experience simple and user-friendly.
